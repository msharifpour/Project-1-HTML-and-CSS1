                <p>
                    When it comes to Clasico success, Messi has been on the winning side more often than Ronaldo,
                    winning 17 matches against Real in all competitions. The Argentine has played against Barca's bitter
                    rivals 38 times in his career across a number of competitions. Of those 38 matches, Messi has tasted
                    defeat 12 times and drawn on nine occasions. La Liga is Messi's happiest hunting ground for Clasico
                    success, with 13 of the 17 victories coming in that competition. In the Champions League, Messi has
                    never lost to Real Madrid, with a win and a draw in the two games he appeared in.

                <p>
                    Ronaldo's success in Clasico games pales in comparison to Messi's, but it must be said that the
                    Portuguese played in fewer encounters, having joined Real in 2009 - a number of seasons after
                    Messi's breakthrough at Barca. The 33-year-old was on the winning side just eight times in 30
                    Clasicos during his time at the Santiago Bernabeu, losing 14 and drawing eight. Even allowing
                    for the fact that Messi has played in eight more games, Ronaldo's win percentage of 26.7% is
                    significantly lower than Messi's 44.7%.

                <p>
                    Again, Messi comes out on top in terms of Clasico goals scored, hitting the back of the net 26
                    times in 38 games between the sides. <br> Most of those goals have come in La Liga, with
                    18 strikes in 24 appearances, six coming in six Supercopa games and two in the Champions
                    League.<br> The only competition in which Messi has not scored against Madrid is the Copa del
                    Rey, having been kept quiet in six matches.

                    Ronaldo is eight goals behind Messi in Clasico appearances with 18, but, again, it is worth noting
                    that the reigning Ballon d'Or winner featured in eight fewer games than his rival.<br> Messi's
                    goal-to-game ratio is marginally better than Ronaldo's (0.68 to 0.60), even though his Portuguese
                    counterpart attempts more shots per game.

                    Once again, Messi blows Ronaldo out of the water in terms of teeing up team-mates in Clasico
                    matches.<br> In addition to scoring 25 himself, the 30-year-old has set up 14 goals in his 37
                    Clasico
                    appearances.

                <p>
                    In 29 appearances against Barcelona for Real Madrid, Ronaldo has supplied an assist for only one
                    goal, which is damning when set next to Messi's contribution to Barca.<br> As well as that, the
                    former Manchester United man is statistically less creative, conjuring just 15 chances in comparison
                    to Messi's 68

                    He may have come up second best to Ronaldo in terms of trophies and insectionidual awards in the
                    last few years, but Messi is the undisputed king of the Clasico.<br> The Argentine has scored more
                    goals, provided more assists and found himself on the winning side more often when Barca and Real
                    face off.<br> Messi has a better goal-to-game ratio and the statistics clearly demonstrate that he
                    contributes more to the overall team effort at Barca than Ronaldo does for Madrid.
