                <h2>El Clasico meaning</h2>
                <p>First things first... El Clasico, or ‘The Classic’, is the name given to any match between Real
                    Madrid
                    and Barcelona. It originally only applied to Spanish championship games between the two; but has
                    come to
                    be used for their meetings in any competitions.</p>

                <p>The first ever El Clasico ended 3-1 to Barcelona in the 1902 Copa de la Coronacion. Since then, Real
                    just shade competitive meetings, winning 97 times to Barca’s 96 along with 52 draws. Including
                    exhibition games, there have been 278 El claiscos - Barca have won 115, Real 101, and 62 draws.</p>

                <h2> El Clasico history </h2>
                <p> 1920s: The first ever LaLiga El Clasico The first LaLiga Clasico took place in February 1929, just
                    two weeks into the first ever LaLiga season. Barcelona’s Les Corts stadium was packed with confident
                    cules that day, but they left disappointed as Real Madrid scored either side of half time and hang
                    on for a 2-1 inaugural win. Barça won the reverse fixture 1-0 – and the first ever LaLiga title –
                    but the first El Clasico win went to the capital.

                <p>
                    The 1934-35 El Clasico fixtures were remarkable, with Barça winning 5-0 at Les Corts before Real
                    Madrid turned it around with an incredible 8-2 win at Chamartin. The home side went 5-1 up after
                    just half an hour, prompting Barça’s Hungarian coach Ferenc Plattko to ask the ball to be changed at
                    the break as he feared foul play! It made no difference as the home side racked up the biggest ever
                    LaLiga El Clasico win.

                <h2>1940s: The birth of El Clasico as we know it today?</h2>
                <p>
                    It could be said that the birth of the intense El Clasico rivalry we know today was born in the
                    1940s, thanks to a number of hot-headed encounters between the two sides. Among them was the highest
                    scoring draw ever registered between these two sides: a 5-5 draw at Les Corts in 1943.

                <h2>1950s: El Clasico becomes Spain’s first televised football match</h2>
                <p>
                    History was made on February 15th 1959 as El Clasico became the first football match ever televised
                    on Spanish television. There was a pre-game scramble for the latest technology, with TV sets quickly
                    selling out across both cities. Real Madrid, featuring the great Alfredo Di Stefano and Ferenc
                    Puskas, won 1-0 that day at the Bernabeu but were unable to prevent Barcelona to win their first
                    LaLiga title in seven years.
