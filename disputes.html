                    After the match, Leo Messi said that Real Madrid players were frustrated, and wanted to injure him.
                    Barcelona was leading by 2-0 over Real Madrid in an El Clasico match on 29th November 2010. In the
                    45th minute, when Messi was trying to dribble past two defenders, Ricardo Carvalho tackled him and
                    brought him down. As Messi got up and tried to walk, Carvalho pushed him by hitting at his face with
                    the elbow.

                <p>After the match, Pep said: “These are just things that happen on the pitch during a game.” Barcelona
                    was leading by two goals to none against Real Madrid in a LaLiga game. When the ball went
                    to Pep Guardiola, Ronaldo went to fetch the ball and tried to take the ball. Guardiola threw it to
                    the other side. Incensed by his action, Ronaldo pushed the legendary coach aside. Ronaldo was lucky
                    to survive the red card.

                <p>
                    This incident happened in a game held on 23rd Dec 2017. Luis Suarez dribbled past Sergio Ramos and
                    passed the ball to his teammate, outside the penalty area. In retaliation, Ramos tackled him badly
                    and pushed Suarez in the ground.  Ramos then tried to pick him up forcibly. This was a shocking
                    display of sportsmanship by Ramos and was shown a yellow card.

                    Pepe is a violent player and thrives on offensive play. He stepped on Messi’s hand when the latter
                    was lying injured on the ground at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium. Everyone watching the game
                    mentioned that it was intentional.
